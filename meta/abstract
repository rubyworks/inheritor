Inheritor providse a means to store and inherit data via
the class heirarchy. An inheritor creates two methods
one named after for the +key+ that provides a reader. And
one named after +key!+ which provides the writer. Because
of the unique nature of inheritor, the reader can not be used
to modify the underlying store or it will not be passed on
to the descendents.
